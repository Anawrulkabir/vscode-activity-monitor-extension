# Cursor Movement Monitor

A VS Code extension that monitors cursor movement and user activity, providing warnings after periods of inactivity to help maintain productivity.

## Features

- **Real-time Activity Monitoring**: Tracks cursor movement, text selection, typing, file operations, and terminal activity
- **Smart Inactivity Detection**: Uses a sophisticated algorithm that tracks consecutive 10-second periods of inactivity
- **Visual Status Bar**: Shows current activity status with color-coded indicators
- **Configurable Warning Time**: Customize the warning time (default: 10 seconds per period)
- **Non-intrusive Warnings**: Gentle notifications that don't interrupt your workflow
- **Easy Toggle**: Enable/disable monitoring with a single command

## How It Works

The extension monitors various user activities:
- Cursor movement and text selection
- Typing and document changes
- File operations (create, delete, rename)
- Terminal activity and commands
- Workspace changes
- Task execution

After 5 consecutive 10-second periods of inactivity (50 seconds total), the extension shows a warning message.

## Commands

- `Cursor Monitor: Toggle Cursor Monitor` - Enable/disable the monitor
- `Cursor Monitor: Reset Timer` - Reset the inactivity counter

## Configuration

You can configure the extension in VS Code settings:

```json
{
  "cursorMonitor.enabled": true,
  "cursorMonitor.warningTime": 10
}
```

- `cursorMonitor.enabled`: Enable or disable the monitor (default: true)
- `cursorMonitor.warningTime`: Warning time in seconds per period (default: 10)

## Status Bar Indicators
